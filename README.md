# Sidtool

Convert Commodore 64 SID music in the form of `.sid` files into other formats! This is still VERY
much work in progress, so expect no usable guidance here. Yet.

It's currently a massive hack made for fun and no profit.

## Installation

    gem install sidtool

## Usage

    $ bundle exec sidtool <input file> > <output file>

The input file is currently generated by some secret stuff, so please come back when we support
reading actual `.sid` files...

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to
run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new
version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`,
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Why the H... did you choose GPL V2 as the license?

I really, really hate the GPL license, but I need to base this project on other GPL projects.
